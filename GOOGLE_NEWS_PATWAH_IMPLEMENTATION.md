# Google News + Patwah Translation Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds Google News scraping with Patwah (Jamaican Patois) translation to your existing news feed system. The system now alternates between event news and Google news articles, with Google news articles being translated to Patwah before publication.

## Features Added

### 1. Google News Scraper (`server/google-news-scraper.js`)
- Scrapes Google News for city-specific articles
- Filters articles for relevance to target cities
- Includes fallback news generation when scraping fails
- Handles anti-bot measures gracefully

### 2. Patwah Translation Service (`server/patwah-translator.js`)
- Translates English news articles to Jamaican Patois (Patwah)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for authentic translation
- Handles missing API keys gracefully
- Validates translation quality

### 3. Enhanced Article Generation System
- Modified `server/index.js` to support both event news and Google news
- New API endpoint: `/api/generate-google-news-article`
- Alternates between article types every 2 seconds
- Maintains same publishing interval as existing event news

### 4. Updated Railway Generation Script
- Modified `railway-10-second-generation.js` to support Google news
- Maintains 2-second interval for continuous content generation
- Toggles between event news and Google news automatically

## How It Works

### Article Generation Flow
1. **Event News**: Generates articles based on Eventbrite events (existing functionality)
2. **Google News**: Scrapes Google News ‚Üí Translates to Patwah ‚Üí Publishes
3. **Alternating Pattern**: Every 2 seconds, alternates between the two types

### Google News Process
1. Search Google News for city-specific articles
2. Filter articles for relevance and quality
3. If no articles found, use fallback news generation
4. Translate article title and content to Patwah
5. Format article with Patwah styling
6. Insert into database with 'google-news' theme

### Patwah Translation Process
1. Send English text to OpenAI with Patwah translation prompt
2. Receive authentic Jamaican Patois translation
3. Maintain original meaning while using proper Patwah vocabulary
4. Format final article with Patwah expressions

## Database Schema Updates

Articles table now includes:
- `theme`: 'local-events' or 'google-news'
- `language`: 'english' or 'patwah'
- `author`: Source attribution
- `eventbrite_url`: Original news source URL

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For Patwah translation (required for real translation)

### Optional Environment Variables
- `API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for API calls (defaults to 'https://holler.news')

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint: `/api/generate-google-news-article`
- **Method**: POST
- **Body**: `{ cityName, state, cityId }`
- **Response**: Article creation status and details

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- ‚úÖ Google News scraping (with fallback)
- ‚úÖ Patwah translation structure
- ‚úÖ Article formatting and database insertion
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing 2-second generation system

## Usage

### Automatic Generation
The system runs automatically every 2 seconds, alternating between:
- Event News (English)
- Google News (Patwah)

### Manual Testing
You can test individual components:
```bash
# Test Google News scraping
node -e "const scraper = require('./server/google-news-scraper'); const s = new scraper(); s.getMostRelevantNews('New York', 'NY').then(console.log);"

# Test Patwah translation (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
node -e "const translator = require('./server/patwah-translator'); const t = new translator(); t.translateToPatwah('Hello world').then(console.log);"
```

## Fallback System

When Google News scraping fails (due to anti-bot measures), the system uses fallback news generation:
- Creates relevant local news content for each city
- Maintains the same translation and publishing flow
- Ensures continuous content generation

## Content Quality

### Patwah Translation
- Uses authentic Jamaican Patois vocabulary
- Maintains original meaning and context
- Includes proper Patwah expressions and idioms
- Validates translation quality

### Article Relevance
- Filters news articles for city relevance
- Scores articles based on location mentions
- Prioritizes local keywords and community content

## Performance

- **Generation Rate**: 1 article every 2 seconds
- **Content Mix**: 50% Event News, 50% Google News (Patwah)
- **Fallback**: Automatic fallback when scraping fails
- **Translation**: Handles API failures gracefully

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Google News API**: Replace scraping with official Google News API
2. **Multiple Languages**: Add support for other Caribbean dialects
3. **Content Caching**: Cache translations to reduce API costs
4. **Quality Metrics**: Track translation quality and user engagement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Google News Found**: System automatically uses fallback news
2. **Translation Fails**: Returns original English text
3. **API Key Missing**: Translation is skipped, but system continues
4. **Network Issues**: Built-in retry logic and timeouts

### Monitoring
Check server logs for:
- `üì∞ Google News (Patwah)` - Successful Google news generation
- `‚ö†Ô∏è No relevant Google News found` - Fallback news being used
- `üîÑ Translating to Patwah` - Translation in progress
- `‚úÖ Google News article created` - Successful article creation

## Conclusion

The Google News + Patwah translation system is now fully integrated and operational. It provides diverse, culturally relevant content while maintaining the same high-frequency publishing schedule as your existing event news system.
