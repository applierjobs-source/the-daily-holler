   - Enter your domain (e.g., `thedailyholler.com`)
   - Railway will provide DNS instructions

2. **In Your Domain Provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):**
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: your-app-name.railway.app
   
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: @ (or root)
   Value: your-app-name.railway.app
   ```

3. **Wait for DNS Propagation:**
   - Usually takes 5-60 minutes
   - Can take up to 24 hours
   - Check with: `nslookup your-domain.com`

4. **Update Environment Variables:**
   - In Railway ‚Üí Variables
   - Update `CORS_ORIGIN` to `https://your-domain.com`

### 3.3 Domain Verification
Test your domain setup:
```bash
# Test Railway subdomain
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/health

# Test custom domain (after DNS propagation)
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```
